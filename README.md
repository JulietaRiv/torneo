# Tenis Tournament

According to the challenge received, this project means to be a sample of determined capabilities developing with php language and Laravel framework.
it consists in create the logic to create and play a tenis tournament, given a valid number of players with name and sex, and a set of attributes with random values (between 0 - 100), which determines the winner.
It includes a players index view, with the list of players, a button to add new (with a very basic form) and a delete button foreach. 
Also includes a main view where is displayed a select with each tournament created (2) with 8 player each, to choose and a button to make them play. Under that, the number of tournament to be displayed and a graph representing every round with the initial players in round 1, and after make them play, all scores are completed, the winners highlighted and the next rounds fulfilled. I added a button (manage Players) to redirect to players index view. and the idea was to add also another button to manage tournaments (create and delete) and give to both the edition functionallity. It might be accomplished in a next iteration.
